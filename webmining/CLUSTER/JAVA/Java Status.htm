<P align=center>&nbsp;<P align=center>The demise of the Java began during the 1880s when Black Javas 
were crossed with Black Langshans and Dark Brahmas to produce the prominent 
bird, the Black Jersey Giant. Almost immediately, the Java and another prominent 
bird, the Jersey Blue, were relegated to farmyard status. The Jersey Blue 
ultimately became extinct and both Java varieties gradually declined during this 
century until only one hatchery, Urch/Turnland Poultry, and several private 
breeders kept them.
